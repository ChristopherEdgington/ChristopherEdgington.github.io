### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 stood out to me because it was the start of my computer science journey and marked my first C++ program on Github. Although this lab was simple, I view it fondly because it taught me essential coding tools that I would constantly use in my future labs, such as std::cout. After reflecting on my progress throughout the semester, I am proud of my improvements and thankful for the basics that the first lab taught me.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 was one of my favorite labs this semester because it included two very different games that I grew up with: Mad Libs and blackjack. While coding these games, I learned how to use vectors and how to utilize command line arguments, which was important for my future labs. My partner and I found lab 5 to be difficult, especially with the ace card's alternating values in blackjack. However, we overcame our struggles and completing the assignment felt rewarding.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11 stood out to me because it was one of the last labs of the semester and it was the most satisfying lab to complete. The challenges involved with this lab's multiple files were difficult to overcome, but these struggles taught me how the files interact with one another. After reflecting on my journey from the simplicity of the first lab to the complexity of this lab, I am thrilled with my ability to code in C++ and my understanding of the basics of computer science.
